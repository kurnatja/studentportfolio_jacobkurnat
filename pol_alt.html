            <p>An example of a policy approach that I think is a step in the right direction concerning the spread of misinformation via social media is that of Twitter. Twitter officials state, “In serving the public conversation, our goal is to make it easy to find credible information on Twitter and to limit the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content” (Roth, Pickles, 2020). Their approach centers around disclaimer labels that they place on tweets that they conclude are potentially misleading or harmful misinformation. These labels alert users that the tweet contains possibly misleading information without censoring the tweet itself. Additionally, users cannot interact with the tweet by way of likes, retweets, or replies. Users can still view the tweet, but they will be essentially informed to take it with a grain of salt. In addition, Twitter has also put a policy in place to ban political ads for a short time as the US Presidential election plays out. The rules are, “No political content as they define it may be promoted; candidates, parties, governments or officials, PACs and certain political nonprofit groups are banned from promoting content altogether” (Coldewey, 2019). Again, Twitter blocks the spread of misinformation from paid political ads while not censoring the discussion of political content by users themselves. I think Twitter is taking the right steps toward mitigating the effects of misleading and harmful misinformation that is spread via social media</p>

        <h2>Policy Alternative</h2>
        <article>
            <p>In practice assignment 3, we looked at how to analyze policy alternatives.In this section, I will use the method outlined in practice assignment 3 to analyze the policy alternative presented by Twitter. First, the nature of the problem is that misinformation is easily spread via social media and it can potentially be harmful and misleading. As I have described in the previous section, Twitter has policies in places to address this, and so far they have had a positive outcome on limiting the amount of misinformation that can be spread on the platform. This is a valuable outcome in solving the problem. I think this is a really great policy alternative that should become a Policy future by adoption in some form by all major social media platforms. I think that, should this happen, the spread of harmful or misleading misinformation via social media will become a lot less of a problem. The action I think that major social media platforms should take is to analyze Twitter’s policies, and figure out how to adapt them to their platform in a way that will be most beneficial to their users.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <article>
            <p>In conclusion, with the number of social media users in the United States, the issue of social media activism and the spread of misinformation needs to be addressed in a way that will strongly hinder people from spreading harmful and misleading information via social media while not infringing on the freedom of speech or engaging in censorship of any kind. Major social media should use Twitter’s approach as an example, and make every effort they can to ensure that their users are getting valid, credible, sound information from their platform should they choose to turn to it for their news and/or information.</p>
