        <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>Early on in the semester, we talked about how to identify stakeholders for certain policy issues, and broke it down into Primary, Secondary, and Key stakeholders in practice assignment 1. In this section, I will use the method from that assignment to identify stakeholders in my chosen policy issue of social media activism and the spread of misinformation.</p>

            <h3>Primary - Social Media Users</h3>
            <p>Social media users are primary stakeholders in terms of social media activism and the spread of misinformation because the validity or credibility of the information they get from social media affects their views and opinions, and sometimes even their actions. While users might not all have a high level of knowledge about this issue, there are many resources available to them for fact checking information they encounter on social media. It would be safe to assume that if people are getting some of their information from social media, they would want it to be credible and valid so they could use it accordingly to shape their views and/or opinions. Therefore, I think social media users would strongly support a policy that cracks down on the spread of information via social media.</p>

            <h3>Secondary - Social Media Platforms</h3>
            <p>I have identified social media platforms as secondary stakeholders concerning the issue of social media activism and the spread of misinformation because platforms want to be able to operate how they see fit; they want to choose how they regulate misinformation (or don’t) based on how they feel about censorship, freedom of speech, etc. Additionally, in the instance of a social media misinformation campaign, social media platforms can face major backlash and criticism based on how their platform allows the misinformation campaign to occur. I think that platforms likely have a high level of knowledge about this issue, and as well have a good amount of resources available to help regulate misinformation on their site. I think that opinions on how to approach misinformation on social media may differ from platform to platform, and therefore I would say that social media platforms are in moderate support of policies that crack down on the spread of misinformation on their sites.</p>

            <h3>Key - Political Figures/Candidates</h3>
            <p>Political figures and/or candidates contribute to the spread of misinformation on social media by providing content that is misleading and/or biased, and targeting that content to certain demographics. This includes political ads paid for by these officials/candidates that they deploy on social media websites. Political figures/candidates have a high level of knowledge about this issue. Additionally, they also have a lot of resources available including fact checking resources to be used against opponents, as well as monetary resources to create things like ads and buy ad space. However, I do think a lot of political figures/candidates operate with ethics that are against the spread of misinformation, which is why I would say that political figures/candidates are in weak support of policies that crack down on the spread of misinformation on social media.</p>

        <h2>Constitutional Freedoms</h2>
        <article>
            <p>With the second practice assignment given to us in this class, we went over the freedoms outlined in the First Amendment to the US Constitution. I think that the issue of social media activism and the spread of misinformation can be closely tied to the freedom of speech. There are those that argue that a policy that regulates misinformation on social media is an infringement on the freedom of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution, and that due to the nature of social media, the deletion of content deemed by the platform to be misinformation would be considered censorship. As platforms do not aim to censor their users, and certainly don’t aim to upset their users, they are faced with the challenge of creating policies that limit the spread of misinformation via social media without infringing on the freedom of speech or engaging in censorship in any way. One of the questions posed in practice assignment 2 was, “Do you think any one of these freedoms could exist alone, without the support of the other four?”. To this question, I answered that the freedoms of the First Amendment are basic rights that should exist everywhere, and that without the freedom of speech, the other four freedoms would cease to exist. This is why it is critical for social media platforms to be diligent about their policy creation concerning the spread of misinformation via social media.</p>
