        <h2> My Policy Issue</h2>
        <article>
            <p>The policy issue I have chosen to focus on in my student portfolio is <em>social media activism and the spread of misinformation</em>. MIsinformation is often spread on social media websites sometimes unintentionally, and sometimes with purpose. Whether it comes from a political figure or candidate attempting mass confusion or reaching for extra supporters, or any regular person with an opinion that shares that content, the spread of misinformation via social media is certainly an issue facing the United States today. A reason for this is because so many people spend so much time on social media every single day, so much so that they will trust the information they read or see on their chosen platform. The problem with this is that anyone can post or share almost any piece of information, credible or not, without regulatory action from the platform itself. Social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc., are becoming sources that people turn to for news or other information due to the rapidly advancing integration of social media into the everyday lives of Americans.</p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>

            <p>As of this year, the total number of social media users in the United States is around 250 million people (Statista, 2020). This means that the vast majority of people in the United States use social media. The audience I hope to reach with my portfolio certainly includes all social media users in the US, however, I think social media activism and the spread of misinformation is particularly pertinent for younger social media users. The reason for this is because for younger generations, particularly “gen z”, is generally more active on major social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. As of 2020, 86% of people ages 18-29 use Facebook, and 38% of the same age group uses Twitter (Khoros, 2020). Additionally, as age increases, the percentage of users decreases. Another reason why I think this issue is a little more important for younger generations is because they are more vulnerable to misinformation and more likely to fall for it.</p>
